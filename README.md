# Kalterm
A simple visualization from the terminal of tintin++ bot status.
![Screenshot](/screenshots/example.gif)

It uses kalterm.tin to create a #port session on 9595, after which the 
kalterm cli app can connect and begin receiving data.  The graphs are
pre-defined for now.  The Log window can be populated by running
`kalterm_msg <log message to send>` in tintin++.
